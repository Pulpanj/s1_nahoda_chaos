This repository is collection of files for Quarto project that I started to record my learning from lectures on **Randomness, Nelinearity and Complexity** (Náhoda, nelinearita, chaos, komplexita).

Lectures run in 2023/2024 academic year by prof. RNDr. Petr Chvosta, CSc. at Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics as part of at Third Age University (U3V) program.

I just retired and so it is all about fun with learning of Julia programming language and trying to understand all these nice topics.

The resulting site is hosted <http://www.pulpanj.me.cz/blogs/u3v/s1_nahoda_chaos/>

Work in  progress ...
